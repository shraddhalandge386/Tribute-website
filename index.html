          <h2>World's youngest Nobel Prize laureate</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Malala Yousafzai</b> ,born on July 12, 1997, in Mingora, Swat Valley, Pakistan, showed early passion for education, inspired by her father's school leadership. At 11, she began anonymously blogging for BBC Urdu, bravely opposing Taliban bans on girls' education. In 2012, a Taliban gunman's attack on her made global headlines, sparking outrage. Malala survived and continued her advocacy, leading to her winning the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 at 17, the youngest laureate ever. She co-founded the Malala Fund, advocating globally for girls' education, and remains a vocal champion for human rights, sharing her story in the bestselling memoir "I Am Malala.".
